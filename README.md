# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction System

## 📋 Introduction
Breast cancer is a critical health issue that affects millions globally, with early and accurate diagnosis being key to reducing its impact. This project offers a simple, user-friendly solution for predicting whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on user-inputted characteristics. By combining a responsive frontend form with a Flask-based machine learning backend, this system empowers users and healthcare professionals with real-time predictions to aid in decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective
To create a lightweight and accessible web application that takes tumor characteristics as input, processes them through a machine learning model, and provides accurate predictions for breast cancer classification.

## 🔍 Problem Overview
Breast tumors fall into two main categories:

- **Benign Tumors**: Non-cancerous growths that pose a lower risk but require monitoring.
- **Malignant Tumors**: Cancerous growths that demand immediate medical intervention.

Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on subjective visual analysis, which can be prone to errors. This project aims to support the diagnostic process by offering data-driven insights with greater accuracy.

## 🛠️ Project Approach

### **Frontend**
#### Technologies Used:
- **HTML5**, **CSS3** for structure and styling.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and form validation.

#### Design Philosophy:
- Grouped inputs into logical sections (Mean, Standard Error, and Worst Features).
- Used a responsive layout with Flexbox for clean, side-by-side input organization.

### **Backend**
#### Framework: Flask
- A lightweight and powerful Python web framework for handling input data and serving predictions.

#### Model Integration:
- The backend uses a pre-trained machine learning model for classification.
- Scikit-learn library was used for model training and integration.

#### Workflow:
1. User submits tumor characteristics via the form.
2. Flask backend processes the data and applies the model for prediction.
3. The result is returned to the user in real-time.

## 📊 Dataset
This system utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, a widely recognized dataset containing tumor characteristics, including:

- **Mean**, **Standard Error**, and **Worst-Case Values** for features like radius, texture, area, smoothness, and compactness.
- **Binary Labels**:
  - `0`: Benign
  - `1`: Malignant

## 📈 Performance
The machine learning model, trained using Logistic Regression, achieved:

- **Training Accuracy**: 95%
- **Test Accuracy**: 93%

These metrics demonstrate the model's ability to generalize well and provide reliable predictions.
